Text is way too small on the initial story blurb, needs to be upscaled for higher resolutions.

1: Sid Basu
Difficulty could be toned down. Pretty much ignored the tutorial and story elements, the presentation needs to be less passive. Also the Z-axis movement was not well-explained.

2: David Liang
Was way too difficult. Did not understand the Z-axis movement at first, the player position on the Z-axis needs to be more obvious. Hard to tell which Z-plane the terrain is on. Enemy hitboxes need to be smaller.

3: Vinay Valluru
Really need the IF to be able to kill enemies, permanently dead enemies + automatic respawn at start of level with saved progress will solve the difficulty issue by allowing people to brute force the levels.

Tutorial text blurbs are too hard/dark to read
better explaination of z-axis
explain why Luc should be used over Ben
    -able to shoot enemies
tutorial text does not dissapear
no explanation of buttons
no explanation of how to beat level
need visual keys for z-axis
